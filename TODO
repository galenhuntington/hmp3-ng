Possible:
 - clean up exit path, so profiling works, and it only shutsdown once
 - cmd line files are not stored in the order they appear on the cmdline
 - Cleaner updates when skipping 
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
 - Igloo's gstreamer binding: http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/minstrel/
