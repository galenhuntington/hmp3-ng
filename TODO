Todo:
 - Print ID3 info
 - Thread-representation of filesystem trees
 - Search
 - Tree structure
 - Refresh handling
 - Check small terminals
 - Black and white terminals
 - Add/delete tracks
 - More profiling.
 - when dropping frames, skip behaves weirdly. temporarily force
 - catch stderr from mpg321
 - debug on linux some more
 - Optimisations:
        + store curses state in global state  (width,height)

Possible:
 - If mpg321 dies, restart it
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
 - Igloo's gstreamer binding: http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/minstrel/
