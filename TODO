Todo:
 - Print ID3 info
 - Solve clrtoeol issue
 - Thread-representation or ipod-style treatment of filesystem trees
 - Get rid of warnings
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - More profiling.
 - search
 - we do a lot of length, take/drop on the state. Perhaps it should be a
   type with O(1) substrs.
 - refresh handling
 - not all exceptions are pretty printed
 - more fault tolerant.
 - FIX: memory creeping over time. Not released?
 - FIX: abiliity to use unsafeUseAsCString 
 - check small terminals
 - Add/delete tracks

Possible:
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
 - Igloo's gstreamer binding: http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/minstrel/
