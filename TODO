Todo:
 - Print ID3 info
 - Solve clrtoeol issue
 - Read directory arguments to populate the list,
 - Thread-representation or ipod-style treatment of filesystem trees
 - Get rid of warnings
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - More profiling.
 - search
 - we do a lot of length, take/drop on the state. Perhaps it should be a
   type with O(1) substrs.
 - refresh handling

Possible:
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
