Possible:
 - breaks on Solaris and  Irix which lack ncurses.h due to WA_BOLD attrs
 - Cmd line *files* (not dirs) are not stored in the order they appear on the cmdline
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - An mpd backend? slightly different protocol, but not too different.
 - We should be able to play oggs
