Todo:
 - Selection. We don't want to do a LOAD on every cursor movement up or down.
 - Print ID3 info
 - Solve clrtoeol issue
 - A basename based on substrs, not copying reverses.
 - Read directory arguments to populate the list 
 - Thread-representation or ipod-style treatment of filesystem trees
 - Volume
 - Automated testing.
 - Stress testing
 - Random mode
 - Loop mode
 - More profiling. Less boxed strings
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library

Possible:
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
