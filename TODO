Todo:
 - Print ID3 info
 - Solve clrtoeol issue
 - Thread-representation of filesystem trees
 - Search
 - Tree structure
 - Refresh handling
 - Check small terminals
 - Add/delete tracks
 - FIX: memory creeping over time. Not released?
 - More profiling.
 - 1 GC per refresh. Fix this.
 - optimisations:
        - store curses state in global state  (width,height)
 - when dropping frames, skip behaves weirdly. temporarily force
   collection of the next frame?
 - clean up properly in cbits/getline

Possible:
 - Automated testing, Stress testing
 - Should random mode not repeat itself?
 - Dynloaded Config.hs
 - A simpler, more obviously correct UI.hs, based on a Ppr library
 - Volume?
 - mpd backend. slightly different protocol, but not too different.
 - Igloo's gstreamer binding: http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/minstrel/
