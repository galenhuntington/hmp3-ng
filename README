            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
          ---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The Glasgow Haskell Compiler >= 6.4       http://haskell.org/ghc
    mpg321 or mpg123                          http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/
    The darcs version of the FPS library      http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html
    A Cabal newer than 1.0                    http://haskell.org/cabal

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

This assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed by default
with newer GHCs. If your Cabal version is too old (v1.0 that comes with
GHC 6.4.x is too old), or if you see:
      dist/build/hmp3-tmp/cbits/utils.o: No such file or directory
errors. You need to download a newer Cabal version first.

Use:
    To populate a playlist, and start:

    $ hmp3 ~/mp3/dir/
     or
    $ hmp3 a.mp3 b.mp3

    From then on this playlist is saved in ~/.hmp3db, and is reloaded
    automatically, if you restart hmp3 with no arguments.

    $ hmp3

    Type 'h' to display the help page. The other commands are explained
    on the help screen, which can be accessed by typing 'h'. Quit with
    'q'.

    The keymaps are configurable by adding your own bindings to
    Config.hs (as are the colours). Edit this file before compilation.

Limitations:
    It only plays mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.
    So no ogg files for now. This is on the todo list though.

Platforms:
    hmp3 has been confirmed to work on:
        OpenBSD/x86
        Linux/x86
        MacOSX/ppc
