            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
          ---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The mpg321 program  ( http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/ )
    The fps library     ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html )

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

Use:
    Type 'h' to display the help page. The current playlist can be saved to
    with 'w', and will be used by default if you start hmp3 without any
    arguments. The other commands are explained on the help screen.

Limitations:
    It only plays mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.  If
    mpg321 fails for some reason, hmp3 doesn't attempt to restart it, (an
    error message will be dumped to stderr).
