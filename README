            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
          ---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The mpg321 program  ( http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/ )
    The fps library     ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html )

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

If you like, you can:
    $ strip dist/build/hmp3/hmp3
before you install.

Use:
    To populate a playlist, and start:

    $ hmp3 ~/mp3/dir/
     or
    $ hmp3 a.mp3 b.mp3

    From then on this playlist is saved in ~/.hmp3db, and is reloaded
    automatically, if you restart hmp3 with no arguments.

    $ hmp3

    Type 'h' to display the help page. The other commands are explained
    on the help screen, which can be accessed by typing 'h'. Quit with
    'q'.

    The keymaps are configurable by adding your own bindings to
    Config.hs (as are the colours). Edit this file before compilation.

Limitations:
    It only plays mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.
    So no ogg files for now. This is on the todo list though.
