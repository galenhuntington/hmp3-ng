            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
          ---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The Glasgow Haskell Compiler >= 6.4       http://haskell.org/ghc
    mpg321                                    http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/
    The darcs version of the FPS library      http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html
    A Cabal newer than 1.0                    http://haskell.org/cabal
    ncurses or curses (not ocurses)

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

This assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed by default
with newer GHCs. If your Cabal version is too old (v1.0 that comes with
GHC 6.4.x is too old), or if you see:
      dist/build/hmp3-tmp/cbits/utils.o: No such file or directory
errors, then you need to download a newer Cabal version first.

N.B. If you don't have ncurses, you'll have to edit the hmp3.cabal file,
and replace -lncurses with -lcurses.

Use:
    To populate a playlist, and start:

    $ hmp3 ~/mp3/dir/
     or
    $ hmp3 a.mp3 b.mp3

    From then on this playlist is saved in ~/.hmp3db, and is reloaded
    automatically, if you restart hmp3 with no arguments.

    $ hmp3

    Type 'h' to display the help page. The other commands are explained
    on the help screen, which can be accessed by typing 'h'. Quit with
    'q'.

Configuration:

    The keymaps are configurable by adding your own bindings to
    Config.hs (as are the colours). Edit this file before compilation.

    If you have a light xterm, set HMP_HAS_LIGHT_BG=true in your shell,
    and hmp3 will use the light color settings by default.

Limitations:
    It only plays mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.
    So no ogg files for now. This is on the todo list though.

    It is possible to use mpg123, however it appears to be more error
    prone, and less stable than mpg321.

    On platforms without a native code generator (e.g. mips64/irix)
    you'll need to remove references to -fasm in hmp3.cabal and Binary.hs)

Platforms:
    hmp3 has been confirmed to work on:
        OpenBSD/x86
        Linux/x86
        MacOSX/ppc
        Irix/mips64

    You need -threaded.
