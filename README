            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
          ---------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    The mpg321 program  ( http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/ )
    The fps library     ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html )

Building:
    $ chmod +x configure Setup.lhs
    $ ./Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    $ ./Setup.lhs build
    $ ./Setup.lhs install

Use:
    Type 'h' to display the help page. The current playlist and track
    are saved on shutdown (into ~/.hmp3db) and if you restart without
    arguments, the playlist and starting track will be taken from the
    previous session. The other commands are explained on the help
    screen, which can be accessed by typing 'h'.

    The keymaps are configurable by adding your own bindings to
    Config.hs (as are the colours). Edit this file before compilation.

Limitations:
    It only plays mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.
